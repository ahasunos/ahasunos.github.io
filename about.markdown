Sonu is a software engineer based out of Assam, India. He spends the majority of my time working on InSpec at [Chef](https://www.chef.io/). Chef InSpec is an open-source framework for testing and auditing your applications and infrastructure. He is currently working on building cloud-native applications and learning about other open-source projects. In his leisure time, he prefers to go cycling or play chess. This blog is an attempt to document his software engineer journey.

This blog is generated using Jekyll. Learn more about jekyll [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll).
